      <p>Let's say you're running an <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/">Elastic Beanstalk</a> application. You might want to stop it so that you're not paying money for it. There's one way to do this by running commands. You can use <code>eb terminate</code> and <code>eb restore</code>, but if you terminate a setup with a database and you restore it, the contents of the database won't be restored. You can also only restore an environment that has been terminated within the last 6 weeks.</p>
<p>Let's see how we can terminate and restore without the 6 weeks restriction and let's also see how does the database backup and restore look like.</p>
<p>The first thing that you have to do is to save your environment, which pretty much consists of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Elastic Beanstalk <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/environment-configuration-savedconfig.html">configuration</a>. This is located in the <code>.elasticbeanstalk</code> directory.</li>
<li><a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/ebextensions.html">Environment customizations</a>. They're located in the <code>.ebextensions</code> directory.</li>
<li>Your source code. Located in your base directory.</li>
<li>A database (optional).</li>
</ul>
<p>My particular app is a single instance Python/Django application with a MySQL database hosted in RDS.</p>
<p>So let's get started.</p>
<h2>Backing up your environment.</h2>
<p>First, get the name of your environment. Mine is <code>neatlinks-dev</code>. Run the following commands after that:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="nb">export</span> <span class="nv">EB_DATE_LABEL</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="sb">`</span>date +<span class="s2">&quot;D%F-T%H-%M-%S&quot;</span><span class="sb">`</span>

<span class="c1"># Name of saved config.</span>
<span class="nb">export</span> <span class="nv">EB_CONFIG</span><span class="o">=</span>saved-<span class="nv">$EB_DATE_LABEL</span>

<span class="c1"># Name of database snapshot.</span>
<span class="nb">export</span> <span class="nv">EB_SNAPSHOT_NAME</span><span class="o">=</span>snapshot-<span class="nv">$EB_DATE_LABEL</span>

<span class="c1"># Instance id for our current database.</span>
<span class="nb">export</span> <span class="nv">EB_DB</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">&quot;aaeag9ndvxonft&quot;</span>

<span class="c1"># Save the environment cname, we&#39;ll need it later.</span>
<span class="nb">export</span> <span class="nv">EB_CNAME</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s1">&#39;neatlinks-dev-www&#39;</span>

<span class="c1"># Save current config.</span>
eb config save neatlinks-dev --cfg <span class="nv">$EB_CONFIG</span>

<span class="c1"># Create and wait for database snapshot.</span>
aws rds create-db-snapshot <span class="se">\</span>
    --db-instance-identifier <span class="nv">$EB_DB</span> <span class="se">\</span>
    --db-snapshot-identifier <span class="nv">$EB_SNAPSHOT_NAME</span>
<span class="nb">time</span> aws rds <span class="nb">wait</span> db-snapshot-completed <span class="se">\</span>
    --db-instance-identifier <span class="nv">$EB_DB</span> <span class="se">\</span>
    --db-snapshot-identifier <span class="nv">$EB_SNAPSHOT_NAME</span>
</pre></div>


<p>So we did two things:</p>
<ol>
<li>We saved the environment configuration. You can list your saved configurations by running <code>eb config list</code>.</li>
<li>We created a snapshot of the database.</li>
</ol>
<p>At this point we can terminate our environment by calling <code>eb terminate</code>. And that's it - Amazon is not charging you anymore - your EC2 instance, RDS instance, load balancers, etc. are down. I don't have a load balancer, but I can verify that everything else is gone.</p>
<p>You should now commit your configs to your source control so that you have them saved when you come back.</p>
<p>Now, your application is sitting safely saved for a while and you decide to restore it.</p>
<h2>Restoring your environment.</h2>
<p>If you have deleted your application, you'll need to run <code>eb init</code>. After that, we'll run the following commands:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="c1"># Create environment. It&#39;s important to specify a cname, so that we don&#39;t have to</span>
<span class="c1"># change our DNS config. This takes a lot of time, so I bump the timeout.</span>
<span class="c1"># This command will print the name of your new database instance.</span>
<span class="nb">time</span> eb create neatlinks-dev --cfg <span class="nv">$EB_CONFIG</span> --cname <span class="nv">$EB_CNAME</span> --timeout 30

<span class="c1"># Get this id from the printed output of &quot;eb create&quot;.</span>
<span class="nb">export</span> <span class="nv">EB_NEW_DB</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">&quot;aa1q3no37rzd407&quot;</span>

<span class="c1"># Delete DB instance. We&#39;ll replace it with the snapshot.</span>
aws rds delete-db-instance --db-instance-identifier <span class="nv">$EB_NEW_DB</span> --skip-final-snapshot
aws rds <span class="nb">wait</span> db-instance-deleted --db-instance-identifier <span class="nv">$EB_NEW_DB</span>

<span class="c1"># Restore from snapshot.</span>
aws rds restore-db-instance-from-db-snapshot <span class="se">\</span>
        --db-instance-identifier <span class="nv">$EB_NEW_DB</span> <span class="se">\</span>
        --db-snapshot-identifier <span class="nv">$EB_SNAPSHOT_NAME</span>
aws rds <span class="nb">wait</span> db-instance-available --db-instance-identifier <span class="nv">$EB_NEW_DB</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Your production setup is ready now! Your application probably won't work though, because your DB endpoint is different. Edit your source code or your own configuration files so that your application connects to the new database. Once done, call <code>eb deploy</code>.</p>
<p>That's it. Your application should be running now. You can use this procedure to rename your Elastic Beanstalk application and environment as well, which is a feature that's missing from the <code>eb</code> CLI app.</p>
